# RiveScript Go Bindings (RSGB)

This repo contains (experimental) bindings to the Go RiveScript module for other
programming languages.

In the cases where the programming language already has a native version of
RiveScript, consider these bindings to be fun experiments, but you should
probably prefer the native versions instead.

In this repo there is a top-level directory for each programming language.
Each one will be accompanied by its own README containing instructions on how
to build and use the module.
